# ReactAngularDotNetPortfolio
Portfolio Editor used as a base to learn the fundamentals of .NET 4.7.2
The .NET side handles management of the projects within a local json file named "projects.json".
This single-page project does not use a database. It updates an existing JSON file and will push it to a CDN like AWS S3 once this project is finally finished.

The REACT/REDUX/Bootstrap front-end, in additions to editing the projects, also converts a file upload to a blob then passes that to the .NET backend.

I started an additional Angular 15 front-end to learn and evaluate it along with RXjS and TailwindCSS.
Angular is a nice comprehensive framework but requires a heavy investment to learn.
Tailwind is a nice foil to Bootstrap, a little troublesome caching-wise but I can recommend it.
